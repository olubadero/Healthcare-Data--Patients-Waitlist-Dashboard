The analysis focuses on both the Average and Median waitlist because it was observed that a few of the waitlist in certain specialty have very high numbers, which can result in a skewed analysis if only the Average waitlist is covered in the Dashboard.

**Insights**:

- There was an over 65000 increase in the current waitlist (2021) in comparison to the previous year (2020) of the same month, this can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.

-	Outpatients accounts for having the most patients on the waiting list with average of 80 patients and the median is 29, which accounts for over 72% of entire patients on the waitlist being outpatients.

-	Across board, patients within the age group of 16 â€“ 64 years have the most patients on the wait list. Whilst, those 65+ have the lowest number of patients on the waitlist across board **see above dashboards**

- **Trend Analysis**: The trend for the Day Case and Inpatient case types shows that the waitlist was steadily declining prior to 2018 -2019. However, from January 2020 the wait list experienced a significant spike in the number of patients on the wait list in comparison to previous years, which may have been as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, around June 2020, both case types experienced a slight decline them the wait list began to rise again in January 2021, most drastically in the day cases, which may be because of the end of the year of festivities which resulted in the spread of COVID-19 again. 
The trend shown in Outpatient wait list through the year analysis shows that the list has continue to exponentially grow and barely coming down.

-	The paediatrics arm of different specialty accounts for 4 of Top 5 specialty of the highest average number of patients on the waitlist, but not in the median analysis. However, Accident & Emergency is both in the top 5 specialty waitlist, average and median, which probably means A&E generally has high patient waitlist.

The average and median are both measures of central tendency, which gives an indication of the average value of a distribution of figures. If both measures are considerably different, this indicates that the data are skewed (i.e. they are far from being normally distributed) and the median generally gives a more appropriate idea of the data distribution.

In light of this and as can be observed above in the Top 5 specialty analysis, the average and median values are considerably different so it can be said that the median Top 5 specialty gives a more appropriate idea of the data distribution.
